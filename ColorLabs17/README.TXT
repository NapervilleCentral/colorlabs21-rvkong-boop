PROJECT TITLE: Sherphard Fairy
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Coloration using RGB values
VERSION or DATE: 11/17/2025(edited due to save)
Author: Ryan Kong

SFtry1: 
Edited by Shivom 
 - Shirt blends too well into the background, need to figure out correct RGB
 - Face has little uniformity in color and looks messy (no smooth transition from purple to yellow)
 - Colors might not be the best in terms of contrast

Modifications made:
 - Adjusted the bounds a little bit to see how it would affect the overall image (didn't do much)
 - Good, not great starting point. At least it looks like it could work compared to previous images.

 - Honestly looks a little worse with the shadows... definitely need to rework the bounds again
 - The light in left eye looks weird, and there's not really any definition in the image. 
 - Currently using 3 purples and 2 yellows, but I don't think 3 purples are necessary when the darker yellow takes up so much of the image
 - Replace a purple with a contrasting color. 

Modifications made: 
 - Used a different, more "in between" color between purple and yellow. 
 - Additionally changed the bounds again to try and increase the contrast between the torso and whiteboard.

SFtry3: 
Edited by my sister
 - The bounds still suck, the main problem is that the whiteboard is less than 5 RGB values off of my hoodie
 - Need to pinpoint an exact RGB, but the face looks a lot better compared to before. 

Modifications made: 
 - Adjusted the fourth "bound" between the yellow shades to divide the hoodie and background into two colours. 
 - Dark purple is not very prominent, nor the 3rd "middle" color: increased those bounds by a lot to balance colour proportion better. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SFtryFINAL: 
 - Looks good! 
 - I wish I could make the hoodie more defined (with 3 main shades instead of 2), but the RGB values are so similar that they are almost all exactly +-5 from 170.
